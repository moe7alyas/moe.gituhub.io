# WebsiteTemplate3
**This is easiest to read in raw mode or in a text editor bc I suck at GitHub formatting.. sorry
**Option 3 of a design for a personal website.. this one's easy to use and make personal, but hard to make changes to and customize (the blocks in it work really well together but are hard to change)

This template is to be used for creation of a personal website, geared towards engineering students. It is a scroll website with area for home, resume, transcript, projects, and contact links.

HOW TO USE:

1. Follow initial directions regarding setting up a personal website using GitHub Pages (https://pages.github.com/) (we'll go over this in the seminar)
2. Clone this repository into your GitHub Pages repository and onto your computer to somewhere you can find it. 
3. Take a look through the website -- all of the pictures on it are currently stock photos and the resume is an example resume. Change all of these to be personal to you. There are comments throughout each file that tell you exactly what to change. 
4. Be creative, play around with formats and styling, and remember -- google is your friend!! Anything you don't know how to do, you can probably find on google. 
5. TEST YOUR WEBSITE -- click all links to make sure they work, resize the page to see how it looks in different shapes, just play around with it until you're sure everything works and looks the way you want it to

Folders:
  -docs -- store your resume and transcript here, and any other necessary files like those 
  -assets -- there's a LOT in here, but you should be most worried about assets/images - this is where all the images are stored
        - you can also check out assets/theme/css or assets/mobirise/css for some css you can try to mess around with (save that for once you finish the website)
        
index.html -- homepage, resume, transcript, projects, contact (lines might be a little off if I make changes to the code and forget to update.. just look around nearby for the comments if it's not exact..)

There's other comments throughout the code but these are the most important action items
                        
 Good luck and happy creating!!
